README.TXT

After opening my project zip file, most of the files can be pretty much ignored. The ones that should be paid attention to however are SuperGame.java and proj1WriteUp.pdf. You should be able to open the pdf just by clicking on it. To run SuperGame.java however, follow the following steps.

-open terminal

-cd into the folder SuperGame.java is located in (I don’t know if this changes upon submission, but for me its 242Proj1)

-input the following code ignoring the quotations “javac SuperGame.java”

-if it compiles (which it does for me but who knows haha) just type “java SuperGame”

-if it does not compile, my writeup thoroughly explains what does and doesn’t work in my tic tac toe board. I encourage you to read to read it all the way through as some problems I mention early on are resolved later, since I wrote it as I was developing the project.
